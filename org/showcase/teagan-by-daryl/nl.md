Daryl made this terrific Teagan in a cropped length, as short as it can go (-20%). They shared:

> I was so intimidated I have put off making anything for ages which was silly of me - this was so easy to make! I'm so chuffed with how well it fits... Turns out all those measurements are worth it, hey

That's what FreeSewing is all about!
